# AirBnB Clone - Web Framework

## General

In the realm of web development, a web framework provides a structure and set of tools for building web applications. It simplifies common tasks, such as routing URLs, handling HTTP requests and responses, and managing data, making the development process more efficient and organized.

## What is a Web Framework

A web framework is a collection of pre-written code and libraries that facilitate the development of web applications by providing essential features and utilities.

## How to build a web framework with Flask

Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python. It allows developers to build web applications quickly and with minimal boilerplate code. To create a web framework with Flask, you need to define routes, handle requests and responses, and manage data using Flask's built-in functionality.

## How to define routes in Flask

Routes in Flask are URL patterns associated with specific functions, known as view functions. These view functions handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses. Routes are defined using the `@app.route()` decorator in Flask.

## What is a route

A route in Flask is a URL pattern that maps to a specific view function. It defines how incoming requests to a particular URL should be handled by the web application.

## How to handle variables in a route

In Flask, route URLs can contain variable parts, indicated by `<variable_name>`. These variables can be captured by the view function and used to customize the response based on the values provided in the URL.

## What is a template

A template in Flask is an HTML file with placeholders for dynamic content. It allows developers to separate the presentation layer from the application logic, making it easier to maintain and update the codebase.

## How to display in HTML data from a MySQL database

To display data from a MySQL database in HTML using Flask, you can retrieve the data from the database using SQLAlchemy or another database library, pass it to the template, and then use template variables to display the data dynamically in the HTML.
